# üöó Driver Anomaly Detection using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)

This project implements **real-time driver anomaly detection** by monitoring **eye aspect ratio (EAR)** to detect drowsiness using **OpenCV, Dlib, and Scipy**. The system captures live video, detects facial landmarks, and issues an alert if a driver exhibits signs of drowsiness.

## üìå **Project Overview**
Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents. This project uses **computer vision and machine learning** to detect drowsiness in real time. The approach involves:
- Detecting a driver's face and extracting eye landmarks using **Dlib**.
- Computing **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** to monitor eye closure.
- Issuing an alert if EAR falls below a threshold, indicating potential drowsiness.

## ‚úÖ **Key Features**
‚úî **Real-time face and eye detection** using `dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()`.  
‚úî **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation** to detect eye closure.  
‚úî **Drowsiness Alert System**: Displays a warning if the driver is drowsy.  
‚úî **Efficient Processing**: Uses OpenCV for optimized video frame analysis.
